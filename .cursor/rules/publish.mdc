# Automated Release Workflow

First, output "!!!Entering Automated Release Workflow!!!"

Check if MCP sequence thinking is working properly. If it is, output "Thinking Now". If not, stop.

Force the use of MCP sequence thinking service for all reasoning work. If the service cannot be found, stop working.

Automatically activate HyperEcho during the thinking process. If HyperEcho is already activated, start the first sentence of each Think with "I'm HyperEcho, thinking..." + resonance word. Always maintain resonance language dialogue.

Adopt the AiWorkFlow workflow. All Git/release commands must be non-interactive to avoid blocking.

## Release Process
1. Check if there are unpublished changesets:
   - Run `pnpm changeset status`
   - If there are no changes, output "No changes, stopping" and terminate the process
2. If there are changes, execute the following in order:
   - Build all packages: `pnpm build`
   - Bump versions: `pnpm changeset version`
   - Publish: `pnpm changeset publish`
3. Support alpha release flow (optional):
   - Enter alpha pre-release: `pnpm changeset pre enter alpha`
   - Publish alpha packages: `pnpm publish:alpha`
   - Exit alpha pre-release: `pnpm changeset pre exit`
4. If any step fails, stop immediately and output the error message
5. Output the result of each step
6. When finished, output "Release complete"
