# Figma Content Feature to Local Component Auto-Mapping Rules

> These rules are used by MCP to automatically select the appropriate local React component based on the content of a Figma node (such as component type, keywords, or structural features) during UI generation.
> The mapping is based on content features, not specific links, for generalization and extensibility.

<!--
Extension notes:
- To support more Figma content features, add new rows in the table above.
- Content features can be keywords, component types, or structural descriptions.
- Use absolute paths (relative to project root) for local component paths.
- The description column should briefly explain the use case.
- When parsing a Figma node, MCP should match the content features in this table and select the corresponding component automatically.
